<h2><strong>History </strong></h2>
<p>Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University is a public institute of higher education, founded on a charter signed by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Government of the Republic of Turkey. The charter was signed on September 30, 1995, in Izmir, Turkey, and created Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University. The day that the charter was signed, September 30, is now Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University Day, which is celebrated every year with celebrations marking the beginning of the academic year, with participation from the leadership of the university, faculty and staff, and also specially-invited guests.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The University presents students with diplomas that are officially recognized in Kyrgyzstan and in Turkey, as well as in other countries.&nbsp; </p>
